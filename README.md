The Task:
In the Language of your choice, write a function that removes all duplicates from an unsorted list of email addresses while leaving the remaining list in the original Order. Prove that this function can handle 100.000 email addresses containing 50% randomly placed duplicates in under 1 second on a typical laptop.

The language of my choice was Java for this task, I created three java classes to:
1. create random emails and write them to a txt file
2. create duplicates of emails and write them to a new txt file
3. remoce the duplicates from list (2) and save result in a new txt file
